## Summary

The Kusama Medium article with the most claps gets the 200 KSM price pool after four weeks. 

## Proposal

After this proposal is merged (approved by more than 50 percent of the current council members on GitHub), people can publish [Medium](https://medium.com/) articles about [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) including their KSM address and a link to this repository. 
The article, which has the most claps on Medium after four weeks will get the price. 

The exact topic of the article doesn't matter (financial, technical, etc.). The only condition is that it explicitly mentions the [Kusama Network](https://kusama.network/). 

*Beware:* During the competition council members might join or leave. Therefore the proposal might no longer have a majority after the four weeks or council members could change their original opinion about the competition.
